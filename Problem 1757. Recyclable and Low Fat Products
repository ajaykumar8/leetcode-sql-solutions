##Leetcode Problem: 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: SQL, Database
Problem Description
Table: Products

Column Name	Type
product_id	int
low_fats	enum
recyclable	enum
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM with values ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' means the product is low fat, and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM with values ('Y', 'N'), where 'Y' means the product is recyclable, and 'N' means it is not.
Task
Write a SQL query to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Example
Input:

Products table:

product_id	low_fats	recyclable
0	Y	N
1	Y	Y
2	N	Y
3	Y	Y
4	N	N
Output:

product_id
1
3
Explanation:
Only products with IDs 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

##Solution 

sql

SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
This query retrieves product_id values for products that are both low fat (low_fats = 'Y') and recyclable (recyclable = 'Y').
